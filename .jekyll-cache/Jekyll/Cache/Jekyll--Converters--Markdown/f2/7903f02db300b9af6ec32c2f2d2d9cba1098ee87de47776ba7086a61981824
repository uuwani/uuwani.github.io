<p>Weâ€™ll do a proof by contradiction: suppose $p_j$ completes round $i$ without receiving a message from $p_i$, $j&gt;i$ and $p_i$ completes round $j$.</p>

<p>Since $p_j$ completed round $i$ without hearing from $p_i$, ATTA, it must be because $p_j$ suspects $p_i$ in round $i$. Weâ€™re using a perfect failure detector $\mathcal{P}$. So in round $j$, we either have:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$p_i$ suspects $p_j$, which is impossible because $p_i$ crashes before $p_j$</li>
  <li>$p_i$ receives the round $j$ message from $p_j$, which is also impossible because $p_i$ crashed before $p_j$ completes round $i &lt; j$</li>
</ul>

<p>We have proved the contradiction in the inverse, and thus the lemma.</p>
