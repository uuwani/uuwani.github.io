I"Ï<p>Baby steps.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re learning Java at the university. I usually feel like I have to test my code every few lines as Iâ€™m writing it, but today I was able to write 200 lines of code, compile it and have it just <em>work</em>. That is definitely a first for me (in Java, at least).</p>

<p>Itâ€™s not technically hard, really. What is hard is changing my programming habits. But Iâ€™m glad to see that Iâ€™m able to, even on small details like this.</p>
