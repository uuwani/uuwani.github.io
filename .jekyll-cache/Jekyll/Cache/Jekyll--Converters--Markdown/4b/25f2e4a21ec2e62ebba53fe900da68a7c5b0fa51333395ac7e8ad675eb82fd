I"÷<p>The web is changing. Weâ€™ve been calling it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0#.22Web_1.0.22">Web 1.0</a>, then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0">2.0</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web#Web_3.0">3.0</a>, <a href="http://bigthink.com/big-think-tv/web-40-the-ultra-intelligent-electronic-agent-is-coming">4.0</a>, <a href="https://flatworldbusiness.wordpress.com/flat-education/previously/web-1-0-vs-web-2-0-vs-web-3-0-a-bird-eye-on-the-definition/">5.0</a>â€¦ Yet to this day, no one really knows what any of the above is supposed to mean! To me, arbitrarily assigning version numbers to the web is sensationalism at best, it isnâ€™t based on anything tangible. And yet, Iâ€™m going to talk about something that I actually believe in: Web Performance 2.0.</p>

<p>A couple of week ago, I went to <a href="https://www.paris-web.fr/">Paris Web</a>, a conference about the Web, held in (you guessed it!) Paris. I heard lots of talks, and coming back from it, thereâ€™s a lot of food for thought. One talk stuck with me, though: in his <a href="https://stefounet.github.io/webperf2.0/#/">WebPerf 2.0</a> talk, <a href="https://twitter.com/stefounet">Stephane Rios</a> called for a new, metaphorical version 2.0 of Web performance.</p>

<h2 id="why-call-it-20">Why call it 2.0?</h2>
<p>Unlike â€œWeb X.0â€, the name â€œWeb Performance 2.0â€ isnâ€™t <em>completely</em> unfounded. It still sounds a bit buzzword-y to me, but I get the idea. In this case, the version number is a bit more coherent, since it is also that of the <a href="https://http2.github.io/">latest version of HTTP</a>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol">HTTP protocol</a> is so indistinguishably tied to how we do performance that itâ€™s almost acceptable to say â€œWeb Performance 2.0â€ instead of â€œHTTP/2 Web Performanceâ€. This new version of HTTP will introduce major changes in how we deal with Web performance, so the number 2.0 is actually based on something concrete.</p>
