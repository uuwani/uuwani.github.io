I"¸<p>Yesterday, the headlines on many tech sites were all about the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/597507018/pebble-time-awesome-smartwatch-no-compromises">new Pebble Time smartwatch</a>. Some places were content with <a href="http://www.cnet.com/products/pebble-time/">posting the facts</a>, but a lot of people recognized that the launch was a forecast of what to expect of the future: <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/02/pebble-time-kickstarter/">WIRED</a> and <a href="http://www.engadget.com/2015/02/24/kickstarters-zach-braff-problem/">Engadget</a> saw it as a tipping point for Kickstarter, and <a href="http://mashable.com/2015/02/24/apple-watch-pebble-time/">Mashable</a> stated that it basically ensured the success of wearables in the future.</p>

<p>Yet I think that thereâ€™s more to it than just that.</p>

<p>The Pebble Time Watch introduces a new paradigm of how we should interact with our devices. In a sense, previous Pebble OS versions were not unlike a smartphone: a lockscreen (watchface) behind which a list of downloaded apps is located. The user has to exit the lockscreen in order choose the correct app to access the functionality that they want; this is the old interaction paradigm.</p>

<p>In a world where things are increasingly being automated, itâ€™s surprising that this simple dynamic hasnâ€™t been automated yet. Itâ€™s surprising that we need to create our own feed of content and functionality on the go.</p>
