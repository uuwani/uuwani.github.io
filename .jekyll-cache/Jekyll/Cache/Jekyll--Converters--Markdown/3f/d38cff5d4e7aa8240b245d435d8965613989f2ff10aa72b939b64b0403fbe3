I"æ<p>For the last few weeks, Iâ€™ve been working on building a <a href="http://mamedev.org/">MAME</a> arcade machine from an old computer. The software part is done (Iâ€™ll cover that in another post), and I have started to prepare the hardware. To save some money, I decided not to buy the <a href="https://www.ultimarc.com/ipac1.html">I-PAC</a>. Instead, hacking a keyboard seemed cheaper, and I just happened to have a lot of old, unused keyboards at hand. I thought that Iâ€™d just connect some wires from the keyboard to a button; when the button is pressed, it would emulate a keystroke. The only problem was that it would take up too much space, and it wouldnâ€™t be practical. The connections wouldnâ€™t be optimal, the keyboard might fallâ€¦ All in all, a better approach was possible, and much needed.</p>

<p>If you open up a keyboard, youâ€™ll often find a small PCB connected to a USB cable (sometimes to some LEDs too), a rubber sheet with dots on it, and to three plastic sheets:</p>
