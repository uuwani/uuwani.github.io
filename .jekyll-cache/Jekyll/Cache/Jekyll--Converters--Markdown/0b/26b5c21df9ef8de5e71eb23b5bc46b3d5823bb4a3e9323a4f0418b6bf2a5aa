  <p>This article assumes a little knowledge of Scala, notably of <code class="highlighter-rouge">Option</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">map</code> and <code class="highlighter-rouge">flatMap</code>. However, these concepts are also found in many other languages, so my hope is that it should also be fairly accessible to people who do not know Scala in particular.</p>

<p>I’ve been a teaching assistant at <abbr title="Swiss Federal Institute of Technology, Lausanne">EPFL</abbr> for various Scala courses for about a year and a half. In this job, I’ve gotten to read and grade a lot of code written by other students; I get to see what people understand well, and what’s causing difficulties.</p>

<p>The most common thing I’ve seen is a tendency for novice Scala programmers to use <code class="highlighter-rouge">Option</code>s quite awkwardly. I think the root of that problem is an incomplete understanding of what monads really are, and what they’re useful for.</p>

<p>And I don’t blame them; monads <em>are</em> something that took a while to click in my head, too. The click came from a piece of advice from Martin Odersky, who said something to the effect of<sup id="fnref:paraphrasing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:paraphrasing" class="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are articles online that try to explain monads as being sort of like a burrito, because they wrap values. Disregard those. Here’s what a monad really is: a parametric type with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">flatMap</code> and a <code class="highlighter-rouge">unit</code> method.</p>

      <p>I’m heavily paraphrasing here, because this was said in a Scala programming class three years ago, and I don’t remember the exact words. <a href="#fnref:paraphrasing" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>
