Hello! My name is Maxime Kjaer, and I'm a Master's student in Computer Science at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.

I am [MaximeKjaer](https://github.com/maximekjaer/) on GitHub, and [@maximekjaer](https://twitter.com/maximekjaer) on Twitter. You can shoot me an email at [maxime.kjaer@gmail.com](mailto:maxime.kjaer@gmail.com) anytime you want! All my public profiles and PGP keys are on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/mkjaer), so check that out if you'd like to get in touch.
